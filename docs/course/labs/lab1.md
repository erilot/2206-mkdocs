# Lab 1: Job Search Report

Look through common job posting sites for technical writer postings. Find three interesting positions, and write a short report formatted in Markdown summarizing your research.

Things to include: What do your postings have in common? What type of skills are they looking for? What type of tools do they expect you to understand? Are there other commonalities that are interesting (for example, do they ask for experience in an Agile work environment)? You can also comment on things like expected experience length or different writing levels.

You can look in any job posting sites you like; good ones include the following:

* [eluta](http://eluta.ca)
* [Glass Door](http://glassdoor.com)
* [Indeed](http://ca.indeed.com)

There is no length expectation with this assignment. It should be as long as it needs to be, and not longer.

Compose this assignment using [Dillinger.io](http://dillinger.io), and export/copy it as a markdown file and submit it to the Lab 1 dropbox.

 We'll discuss your findings next week.
