# Part 1: High level overview

Choose a technology or business process taht you want to document. This can be software, hardware, a combination of the two, or something more abstract like a publishing workflow system. Then, write a brief summary describing:

* What the technology (or process) is.
* What the work environment is like where this technology is used, and what problem the technology solves. You should be as specific as possible here -- this is essentially defining your project's scope, and if you are too broad now ("Using Excel") your project will become a nightmare. Go for something much more narrow ("Maintaining Shoe Inventory With Excel"). 
* List 3 user roles you're writing for. If you have real people you can interview or model for these roles, that's best, but if you have to settle for archetypes that's ok.
* List 3 potential resource groups, like the STC (Society for Technical Communication) or trade groups related to your technology. Think broadly here; there are almost certainly at least three groups of users you could talk to, even if they are informal.
* List 5 other information sources you can call on to plan or develop your documentation. This can include websites, forums, even existing documentation.
